Small citrus and long little bitter hoppy aftertaste. Overall : I must say that for a pils it’s a really nice one. Truly surprising body and more complex aromas then a regular pils.\"\n",

Flavor is actually pretty bitter; grainy, wet dog aftertaste.  Tastes distinctly European.  Despite its flaws (skunk aroma, wet dog aftertaste) this is not a bad pilsener at all.  I can see why America’s brewing pioneers felt the need to copy it all those years ago.  If only they could have maintained the quality of this beer.\"\n",

This is the pilsener model for others to imitate.  The medium body beer has a smooth finish.  The color was deep gold with a modest head.\n",

Flavor starts lightly sweet and acidic, then finishes lightly sweet, acidic and bitter. Palate is light to medium, watery with a lively carbonation.

      "\"Found this at a local grocery store in a pint can.  Color is golden yellow with a little head when poured with medium carbonation.  Aroma has a floral hoppiness to it along with a less distinctive sweet malt aroma.  Flavor is very Saazy floral with sweet malt flavor and no aftertaste.  I have had this from the bottle and tasted the skunkiness but from the can, this is completely absent and really allows you to taste what the beer should taste like.\"\n",
      "33cl bottle at home: Bright med-dark gold with a very white frothy head. Sweet pale malt nose with honey. Noble hops supply some earthy spice. Very light toast.  Flavor is a good blend of sweet malt  and smooth hop. It definitely leans more to the sweet malt side than the hop side. Effervescent hop bite in middle but back to malt for the finish. Some toast pops up in the middle. Crisp with a bit of a minerally quality.\n",
      "\"Had this at a beer tasting event. Hoppy aroma covered in skunk. Nice golden appearance. Flavor wasn’t nearly as skunky as the aroma was. It was quite hoppy, well balanced. Nice to taste a true pilsener rather than the weak American light beer type pilsener. Still, I’m not a huge fan of this type of beer. Too light, still too watery, and a skunky profile thanks to the green bottle. The flavor is the best part, which is what matters, but overall the beer isn’t anything special in my eyes.\"\n",
      "\"Standard pilsener appearance - yellow/gold with a decent looking white head. The aroma is mostly of grassy hops with a nice, but restrained malt sweetness. The flavor is nicely hoppy, grassy, herbal and a hint of floral presence as well. This balances really nicely the malt characteristics of the beer to create a solid bittersweet flavor. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth, yet just crisp enough to be refreshing. This is an eminently drinkable beer.\"\n",
      "\"Tall boy can at U.S. Cellular Field poured into a tall plastic cup. Sizeable head that dissipates fairly quickly and a body that looks like a nice somber honey color. Nice looking. Initial aromas are a little grassy, some nice noble hops sweetness, and a little bit of pilsener malt stink. Taste is assertive. A nice bitter sweetness balanced by nice pilsener malt. A very nice beer and a good find at a ball game.\"\n",

There is an initial almost sweet, creamy malt and hop flavor, a definite grain presence, and perhaps some corn.

Floral and spicy hops dominate the nose, with a gorgeously rich buttery biscuit aroma underneath. Rich, complex malt in the mouth - a hint crusty. Firm herbal hop character hints at lemon and pepper. Firm lingering bitterness, tending strong.  Very very good - just lacking some zippy vitality. A benchmark beer that is head and shoulders above any other classic Pilsner I’ve tried, and would certainly be well above 4 if it were fresh.\"\n",

Not exactly the best pilsener in the world I guess, but it didn’t dissapoint me.\"\n",

It diminishes, but continues to ring the glass.  Aroma is bread dough and sweet hop flowers.  Taste is the sweetness of lightly toasted malt and a mild Saaz hop bitterness.

Body is on the watery side of medium, and the astringency makes for a slightly hard finish.  Average at best.\"\n",

It had a slightly bitter finish and little aftertaste.  I’m used to drinking heavy stouts or Belgian Whites, and it is refreshing to have a simple beer like this once in a while.

Quite a fantastic beer.\"\n",

The carbonation continues throughout the entire drinking process.  Slightly bitter taste at first, but becomes more watery throughout the drink.  Reminds me of a Budweiser with a stronger scent, and  slightly bitter.  If I had a choice of beers to serve, I would choose this one over Budweiser, but the decision was close.  Overall, I would call this a Bud of the Czech.\"\n",

The flavor was lightly sweet and moderately bitter with an average-length, heavily bitter with a sweet, milk-like finish and pretty honey retros.

The magic is how the balance of flavors changes with each sip. The hops are at first subdued, barely there, just some saaz spiceyness around the edges.
